This folder contains the problem statements, my answers and the empty code and text files provided in the Week 1 Homework of CSE160.

This week's homework is 'Welcome to Python' and is composed of programming exercises.

# Learning Objectives:

- write Python code using variables and loops to solve simple mathematical problems
- become familiar with the an IDE and running Python programs
- gain practice printing results to match a specification exactly

*Note: I personally use Atom as IDE rather than Canopy (as suggested in the homework assignments)
